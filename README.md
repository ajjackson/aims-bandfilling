aims-bandfilling
================

Calculates a band-filling correction from FHI-aims output files.
This is useful for extrapolating a finite defect energy to the 
dilute limit when performing ab-initio calculations on defective
semiconductors.


For more information on this calculation see Persson et al (2005).
