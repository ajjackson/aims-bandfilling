aims-bandfilling
================

Calculates a conducting band-filling correction for shallow n-type defects from FHI-aims 
output files. This is useful for extrapolating a finite defect energy to the dilute limit 
when performing periodic ab-initio calculations on defective semiconductors. For a localised 
defect state in the band gap of a material the correction should be close to zero.
